> Override for Codex users who want **Claude Code CLI**, not a second Codex agent, to act as the reviewer/helper. Install this package **after** `skills/skills-codex/*`.

Whenever the upstream skill asks for an external reviewer/helper, write the complete focused prompt to `$PROMPT_FILE`. For a one-shot independent review, run:

```bash
claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format json --model opus --effort max < "$PROMPT_FILE" | tee "$RAW_REVIEW_JSON"
```

For multi-round reviewer discussion, keep automation non-interactive but preserve continuity with `--session-id` on the first call and `--resume` on follow-up calls; see `../shared-references/claude-cli-review.md`.

# Training Check

Periodically read WandB metrics during training to catch problems early. Do not wait until training finishes to discover it was a waste of GPU time.

## Context: $ARGUMENTS

## Constants

- WANDB_ENTITY and WANDB_PROJECT: read from CLAUDE.md or passed as argument (format: `entity/project/run_id`)
- CHECK_INTERVAL: starts at 10 minutes, then gradually increases if consistently healthy: 10 min → 20 min → 30 min → 60 min (cap)
- **REVIEWER_MODEL = `claude-cli`** — Claude reviewer invoked through direct `claude -p` CLI calls, using `--session-id` / `--resume` for multi-round discussion, following `../shared-references/claude-cli-review.md`.

## When to Use

- After training is confirmed running (session alive, loss decreasing for first few steps)
- Set up via CronCreate to fire periodically during training
- **This skill checks training QUALITY, not process HEALTH.** Process health (session alive, GPU utilization) is `watchdog.py`'s job. Resolve it through `.aris/tools/watchdog.py`, `tools/watchdog.py`, `$ORBIT_REPO/tools/watchdog.py`, then `$ARIS_REPO/tools/watchdog.py`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read WandB Metrics

```python
import wandb
api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run("<entity>/<project>/<run_id>")
history = run.history()
```

If WandB is unreachable (API error, network issue), fall back to reading the log file directly via SSH:
```bash
ssh server "tail -100 /path/to/training.log"
```

Check these signals:
- **Loss trend**: Is training loss decreasing over the last N steps?
- **Eval metrics**: Are evaluation metrics improving (or at least not degrading)?
- **NaN / Inf**: Any NaN or Inf values in loss or gradients?
- **Spikes**: Sudden large jumps in loss (>10x normal variance)?
- **Learning rate**: Is the schedule behaving as expected?
- **Gradient norm**: Exploding or vanishing?

### Step 2: Judgment

| Signal | Judgment | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| NaN/Inf in loss | **Clearly bad** | Stop training, investigate |
| Loss diverging (increasing for >N steps) | **Clearly bad** | Stop training, investigate |
| Eval metrics significantly worse than baseline | **Clearly bad** | Stop training, investigate |
| Loss decreasing, metrics improving | **Clearly fine** | Continue, increase check interval |
| Loss flat but not diverging | **Unsure** | → Step 3 (Codex judgment) |
| Metrics noisy, can't tell trend | **Unsure** | → Step 3 (Codex judgment) |
| Slightly worse than baseline but still early | **Unsure** | → Step 3 (Codex judgment) |

### Step 3: Codex Judgment (only when unsure)

Only escalate to Codex when the signal is ambiguous. For clearly good or clearly bad signals, act directly.

```text
Write the complete fresh Claude review/help prompt to `$PROMPT_FILE`.
Preserve the role, files-to-read, objective, and required output schema from this original call shape.

If this review may need later follow-up, create and save a Claude CLI session ID on this first call.

prompt: |
    TRAINING HEALTH CHECK — need your judgment on ambiguous metrics.

    Run: <entity>/<project>/<run_id>
    Current epoch/step: X / Y total
    Training loss (last 10 checkpoints): [values]
    Eval metrics (last 3 evals): [values]
    Baseline reference: [numbers from paper/reproduction]

    What I'm unsure about: [specific concern]

    Please respond with exactly one of:
    - STOP: clearly problematic, should kill training
    - CONTINUE: looks fine, check again next interval
    - WAIT: not enough data to judge, check again sooner
```

```bash
PROMPT_FILE="${PROMPT_FILE:-.aris/review-prompts/claude-review-round-N.md}"
RAW_REVIEW_JSON="${RAW_REVIEW_JSON:-.aris/review-outputs/claude-review-round-N.json}"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$PROMPT_FILE")" "$(dirname "$RAW_REVIEW_JSON")"
CLAUDE_SESSION_ID="${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-$(python -c 'import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())')}"
CLAUDE_SESSION_ID_FILE="${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID_FILE:-.aris/review-outputs/claude-session-id.txt}"
printf "%s\n" "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID" > "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID_FILE"
claude -p --session-id "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID" --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format json --model opus --effort max < "$PROMPT_FILE" | tee "$RAW_REVIEW_JSON"
```

Save the raw Claude CLI JSON before summarizing it. Treat the response text inside the JSON as the reviewer/helper output.

### Step 4: Act

| Decision | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Stop** | Kill the training session. Save the WandB run URL, key metrics, and reason for stopping. Log to project notes for debugging. |
| **Continue** | Do nothing. Will be invoked again at next interval (increase interval if consistently healthy). |
| **Wait** | Do nothing but keep the current short interval (don't increase). |

## Integration with Watchdog

Training-check and `watchdog.py` operate at different levels:

| Layer | Tool | What it checks | Frequency |
|-------|------|----------------|-----------|
| Process health | watchdog.py | Session alive? GPU active? | Every 60s (continuous) |
| Training quality | training-check | Loss trend? Metrics improving? | Every 10-60 min (periodic) |

Use both together:
- Watchdog catches crashes and idle GPUs immediately
- Training-check catches subtle quality issues (loss plateau, metric degradation)

## Rules

- Do not stop training on first sign of noise — some loss spikes are normal. Look at **trends over multiple checkpoints**.
- When stopping training, always save the WandB run URL and key metrics as evidence.
- If both WandB and log files are unreachable, report the connectivity issue and try again next interval. Do not assume training is broken.
- Gradually increase check interval when healthy (10 → 20 → 30 → 60 min). Reset to 10 min after any anomaly.
- This skill is meant to be automated via CronCreate — do not ask the user whether to set it up. Just set it.

## CronCreate Setup Example

```
After training is confirmed stable:
  CronCreate (recurring, every 10 minutes initially):
    "Run /training-check for wandb run <entity>/<project>/<run_id>"
```

As the check interval increases, delete the old CronCreate job and create a new one with the longer interval.
