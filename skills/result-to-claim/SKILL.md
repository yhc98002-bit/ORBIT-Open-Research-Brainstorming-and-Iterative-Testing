# Result-to-Claim Gate

Experiments produce numbers; this gate decides what those numbers *mean*. Collect results from available sources, get a Codex judgment, then auto-route based on the verdict.

## Context: $ARGUMENTS

## BRIS Claim Construction Gate

This gate is always-on. Before paper writing, load:

- `shared-references/research-agent-pipeline.md` — v1.3 stage map and hard gates G14, G16, G17, G18, G19
- `shared-references/research-harness-prompts.md` sections `21`, `22`, and `25` (v1.3 numbering; old v1.0 sections `12`, `13`, `15` are mapped via the appendix)
- `shared-references/reviewer-independence.md`

Run `mkdir -p bris-research/`. Always write or update:

- `bris-research/CLAIM_CONSTRUCTION.md` — claim → evidence → control → scope → limitation
  chain (Stage 21). Required by G16 and G18 before `/paper-writing`.
- `bris-research/HUMAN_DECISION_NOTE.md` — short note summarizing what is believed, what
  evidence supports it, what remains uncertain, agent's recommendation, and ending with one
  of `PROCEED / NARROW / REDESIGN / RE-READ / CHANGE BENCHMARK / STOP / HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED`.
  Required by G15 and G19 before scale-up or paper writing.
- `bris-research/NEGATIVE_RESULT_STRATEGY.md` if the method ties, fails, or only partially
  supports the intended claim (Stage 22).

Use the claim → evidence → control → scope → limitation chain. Downgrade claims when
evidence is partial. If the result is negative, evaluate whether the contribution can
become benchmark diagnosis, baseline ceiling analysis, failure taxonomy, negative result,
regime map, evaluation protocol, task ontology contribution, or controlled reproduction.

**G14 inline check (mandatory):** if `bris-research/NULL_RESULT_CONTRACT.md` triggered a
tie or failure outcome, **refuse to write positive framing** in `CLAIM_CONSTRUCTION.md`
or `RESULT_INTERPRETATION.md`. Frame the result honestly per Stage 22 — invoke
`NEGATIVE_RESULT_STRATEGY.md` instead of forcing a success story. No exception.

**G17 inline check (mandatory):** if a result is being framed post-hoc as "what we
predicted" — i.e., the current claim emerged from `bris-research/RESULT_INTERPRETATION.md`
or `bris-research/FAILURE_TO_INNOVATION.md` rather than from a pre-registered hypothesis
in `bris-research/CONTROL_DESIGN.md` — label it explicitly in `CLAIM_CONSTRUCTION.md` and
in any downstream paper as **"exploratory finding, not pre-planned hypothesis."** Do NOT
present post-hoc reframings as pre-planned hypotheses. No exception.

## When to Use

- After a set of experiments completes (main results, not just sanity checks)
- Before committing to claims in a paper or review response
- When results are ambiguous and you need an objective second opinion

## Workflow

### Step 1: Collect Results

Gather experiment data from whatever sources are available in the project:

1. **W&B** (preferred): `wandb.Api().run("<entity>/<project>/<run_id>").history()` — metrics, training curves, comparisons
2. **EXPERIMENT_LOG.md**: full results table with baselines and verdicts
3. **EXPERIMENT_TRACKER.md**: check which experiments are DONE vs still running
4. **Log files**: `ssh server "tail -100 /path/to/training.log"` if no other source
5. **docs/research_contract.md**: intended claims and experiment design

Assemble the key information:
- What experiments were run (method, dataset, config)
- Main metrics and baseline comparisons (deltas)
- The intended claim these experiments were designed to test
- Any known confounds or caveats

### Step 2: Codex Judgment

Send the collected results to Codex for objective evaluation:

```
mcp__codex__codex:
  model: gpt-5.5
  config: {"model_reasoning_effort": "xhigh"}
  # Sandbox is set globally in ~/.codex/config.toml as sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access".
  # Codex MCP per-call config does not accept a sandbox key — see shared-references/reviewer-routing.md.
  prompt: |
    RESULT-TO-CLAIM EVALUATION

    I need you to judge whether experimental results support the intended claim.

    Intended claim: [the claim these experiments test]

    Experiments run:
    [list experiments with method, dataset, metrics]

    Results:
    [paste key numbers, comparison deltas, significance]

    Baselines:
    [baseline numbers and sources — reproduced or from paper]

    Known caveats:
    [any confounding factors, limited datasets, missing comparisons]

    Please evaluate:
    1. claim_supported: yes | partial | no
    2. what_results_support: what the data actually shows
    3. what_results_dont_support: where the data falls short of the claim
    4. missing_evidence: specific evidence gaps
    5. suggested_claim_revision: if the claim should be strengthened, weakened, or reframed
    6. next_experiments_needed: specific experiments to fill gaps (if any)
    7. confidence: high | medium | low

    Be honest. Do not inflate claims beyond what the data supports.
    A single positive result on one dataset does not support a general claim.
    If the method ties or fails, do not force a positive story. Identify whether a negative-result contribution remains.
```

### Step 3: Parse and Normalize

Extract structured fields from Codex response:

```markdown
- claim_supported: yes | partial | no
- what_results_support: "..."
- what_results_dont_support: "..."
- missing_evidence: "..."
- suggested_claim_revision: "..."
- next_experiments_needed: "..."
- confidence: high | medium | low
```

### Step 3.5: Check Experiment Integrity (if audit exists)

**Skip this step if `EXPERIMENT_AUDIT.json` does not exist.**

```
if EXPERIMENT_AUDIT.json exists:
    read integrity_status from file
    attach to verdict output:
        integrity_status: pass | warn | fail

    if integrity_status == "fail":
        append to verdict: "[INTEGRITY CONCERN] — audit found issues, see EXPERIMENT_AUDIT.md"
        downgrade confidence to "low" regardless of Codex judgment

    if integrity_status == "warn":
        append to verdict: "[INTEGRITY: WARN] — audit flagged potential issues"
else:
    integrity_status = "unavailable"
    verdict is labeled "provisional — no integrity audit run"
    (this does NOT block anything — pipeline continues normally)
```

See `shared-references/experiment-integrity.md` for the full integrity protocol.

### Step 4: Route Based on Verdict

#### `no` — Claim not supported

1. Record postmortem in findings.md (Research Findings section):
   - What was tested, what failed, hypotheses for why
   - Constraints for future attempts (what NOT to try again)
2. Update CLAUDE.md Pipeline Status
3. Decide whether to pivot to next idea from IDEA_CANDIDATES.md or try an alternative approach

#### `partial` — Claim partially supported

1. Update the working claim to reflect what IS supported
2. Record the gap in findings.md
3. Design and run supplementary experiments to fill evidence gaps
4. Re-run result-to-claim after supplementary experiments complete
5. **Multiple rounds of `partial` on the same claim** → record analysis in findings.md, consider whether to narrow the claim scope or switch ideas

#### `yes` — Claim supported

1. Record confirmed claim in project notes
2. If ablation studies are incomplete → trigger `/ablation-planner`
3. If all evidence is in → ready for paper writing

### Step 5: Update Research Wiki (if active)

**Skip this step entirely if `research-wiki/` does not exist.**

```
if research-wiki/ exists:
    # 1. Create experiment page
    Create research-wiki/experiments/<exp_id>.md with:
      - node_id: exp:<id>
      - idea_id: idea:<active_idea>
      - date, hardware, duration, metrics
      - verdict, confidence, reasoning summary

    # 2. Update claim status
    for each claim resolved by this verdict:
        if verdict == "yes":
            Update claim page: status → supported
            python3 tools/research_wiki.py add_edge research-wiki/ --from "exp:<id>" --to "claim:<cid>" --type supports --evidence "<metric>"
        elif verdict == "partial":
            Update claim page: status → partial
            python3 tools/research_wiki.py add_edge research-wiki/ --from "exp:<id>" --to "claim:<cid>" --type supports --evidence "partial"
        else:
            Update claim page: status → invalidated
            python3 tools/research_wiki.py add_edge research-wiki/ --from "exp:<id>" --to "claim:<cid>" --type invalidates --evidence "<why>"

    # 3. Update idea outcome
    Update research-wiki/ideas/<idea_id>.md:
      - outcome: positive | mixed | negative
      - If negative: fill "Failure / Risk Notes" and "Lessons Learned"
      - If positive: fill "Actual Outcome" and "Reusable Components"

    # 4. Rebuild + log
    python3 tools/research_wiki.py rebuild_query_pack research-wiki/
    python3 tools/research_wiki.py log research-wiki/ "result-to-claim: exp:<id> verdict=<verdict> for idea:<idea_id>"

    # 5. Re-ideation suggestion
    Count failed/partial ideas since last /idea-creator run.
    If >= 3: print "💡 3+ ideas tested since last ideation. Consider re-running /idea-creator — the wiki now knows what doesn't work."
```

## Rules

- **Codex is the judge, not CC.** CC collects evidence and routes; Codex evaluates. This prevents post-hoc rationalization.
- Do not inflate claims beyond what the data supports. If Codex says "partial", do not round up to "yes".
- A single positive result on one dataset does not support a general claim. Be honest about scope.
- If `confidence` is low, treat the judgment as inconclusive and add experiments rather than committing to a claim.
- If Codex MCP is unavailable (call fails), CC makes its own judgment and marks it `[pending Codex review]` — do not block the pipeline.
- Always record the verdict and reasoning in findings.md, regardless of outcome.

## Review Tracing

After each `mcp__codex__codex` or `mcp__codex__codex-reply` reviewer call, save the trace following `shared-references/review-tracing.md`. Use `tools/save_trace.sh` or write files directly to `.aris/traces/<skill>/<date>_run<NN>/`. Respect the `--- trace:` parameter (default: `full`).
